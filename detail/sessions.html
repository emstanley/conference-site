Moving to serverless allows you to take your application development, deployment, and economics to a new level while delivering software to your customers faster and with cheaper. But there are also significant trade-offs to keep in mind. Pratik Patel walks you through a short introduction to serverless architecture and explains why it’s an architectural style to pay attention to, especially if your company is already deploying cloud applications. You’ll learn how serverless architecture fits into the world of microservices and examine the pyramid of application development and deployment. You’ll then put on your architect hat to look at serverless options and how they impact applications architecture. You’ll leave with a solid understanding of the benefits (faster deployment, more often, with lower cost) and challenges (debugging, data stores, testing, and more) of moving to a serverless architecture.",

What if there was a mobile app that could intelligently scan the bottles and use machine learning with a custom trained model to suggest for you the World’s Greatest Minibar Cocktail? What if that app was written using NativeScript-Vue, and the training was done using TensorFlow? \n \n In this talk, we’ll learn how to create a native mobile app using Vue.js, and how to integrate TensorFlow custom models, allowing your mobile app to train data on device. Join me as we walk through the creation of MixoLogy, sampling an original creation concocted for you via machine learning, based on a scan of a minibar.

But in 2019, webpage complexities have resulted in resource loading and rendering intricacies. Added, consumer comportment has shifted dramatically. Late 2016 saw the mobile client usage eclipse the desktop one for the 1st time in history. This has left developers with new found duties, notably: the disciplined delivery of data.\n\nWe once referred to raw timing data provided by the browser to measure performance. The modern web experience soon demanded metrics beyond DOMContentLoaded and onLoad events. We've now introduced more complex measurements with Paint Timing API, Network Information API and Time To Interactive to name a few.\n\nPlanet Of The APIs peruses present-day and even experimental APIs employed in assessing and accelerate resource loading and measuring page renders. And with an increasingly favourable browser landscape, we will look at how we can start to use these in the on going pursuit of providing stellar and speedy mobile user experiences.\n\n",

                "Abstract": "With the rise of design-led organizations, the role of designer has shifted from that of mere stylist to being a business' number one problem solver. To build products that people love, designers have to do more than just solve problems. They must structure the way they work, establishing a system of guiding values and principles that support and drive the design process. This design system includes documentation, workflows, and even code. To be successful, it requires the support and participation of the entire organization.\n \n This is because design systems are not just for designers. A good design system will provide a solid foundation for your organization, enabling product managers and engineers to make decisions without relying on constant feedback from designers. In turn, designers will gain time to focus on exploring and solving other problems. \n \n Based on material from her upcoming book with co-author Taurie Davis, Sarrah will guide you through the basics of building a design system. You will learn how to define a design language that can be understood across teams and establish a communication strategy to sell your system to key stakeholders and other contributors.",

Design Thinking recommends we teach others to design, but how could this work in practice? Our teammates are working towards goals which may not neatly align with user experience. If we are to build a culture of designing for the user, it must be self-sustaining.\nThe most effective designers are bridges between functions. These folks are practicing Integrative Thinking. Integrative Thinking holds opposing ideas at once. It observes their dualities and generates a new solution. We unblock and enhance process instead of forcing design onto others.\nIn this talk, we will explore Integrative Thinking. I will share a practice which will have your team to:\n\n- Navigate complex, and often conflicting, user needs. \n- Build a self-sustaining culture of user centered design. \n- Enjoy multiplier effects on productivity and fulfillment at work.",

I will provide the basic information that developers need to dive into the complex world of web accessibility.\n\nThe starting point will be a review of the POUR principles that dictate that websites should Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust, and after that, I will dive into more hands-on topics related to the coding and development of accessible websites and the testing tools and techniques available for determining how accessible our applications are. I will do live demos of tools like screen readers and visual impairments simulators with the goal of helping attendees understand the challenges faced by people with disabilities when surfing the web and to show the difference that accessible coding can make for users of assistive technologies. disabilities who are excluded from the amazing opportunities created by the digital revolution, given its transformative power the United Nations now considers access to the internet a basic human right and since the world-wide-web is the most popular way to access the internet, web accessibility has to be one of our top priorities as an industry.",

Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI) is taking the world by storm and creating technical solutions we never thought possible. By combining AI and IoT using the cloud and Edge capabilities, we can build something that can only be described as the intersection of awesome.\nIn this session, we will explore and join AI cloud-native deep learning technologies and IoT cloud enabled devices by walking through and building an IoT solution with AI superpowers.
