Pre-Engineering, she spent her nights and weekends performing in the Bay Area as a singer/actress, before attending Hackbright in 2016. Perhaps the only engineer you'll meet who has been in \"Hairspray\", \"Xanadu\", \"Carrie the Musical\", and \"Jerry Springer: the Opera\"- she is passionate about bringing people with non-traditional backgrounds into the world of tech. If you're trying to place her face, yes- she's the young woman giving the awkward thumbs up in the \"What It's Like to be a Woman at a Tech Conference\" article (which she also wrote). Previously, she worked at Sentry.io where she created the (DevRel Award Winning) Sentry Scouts program (a camp themed meet-up ft. patches, s’mores, giant squirrel costumes, and boozy hot chocolate). And was recently featured in the Grace Hopper Conference 2018 gallery featuring 15 influential women in STEM by AnitaB.org. In early 2018 was named one of the \"200+ Thought Leaders in Crypto and Blockchain\" and still knows absolutely nothing about Crypto and Blockchain. Seriously- not a thing. She considers it her greatest accomplishment.",

                "bio": "Stefanie Jewett is the founder and CEO of Activvely, the premiere social-pairing app that connects you with platonic fitness buddies.\n\nAfter​ ​five years of covering hard news at CNN her creativity breached the spillway and Activvely was born.\n\nA Miami native, Stefanie grew up in a Spanish-speaking household, her Cuban roots never too far from her heart.\n\nLiving in Central Virginia, Maryland and Washington D.C. inspired her to pursue a journalism career in earnest. This passion for news would see her at the U.S. Congress​,​ National Republican Senatorial Committee, WSET, the Alliance to Save Energy​ ​and eventually landing a job at CNN.\n\nWorking on several projects and shows including Crossfire and the Situation Room, she held her own among the most elite journalists at the World Headquarters and the Washington D.C. bureau.\n\nStefanie returned to Atlanta with a singular goal: to lift the stigma off swipe platforms solely being used for dating and help the people of this vibrant city connect.\n\nHer commitment to building intentional and impactful communities led her to create, Startup Sisters USA, a space where women of wild ambition can come together and collaborate.\n\nMost recently, Stefanie was selected for Atlanta Tech Village’s “It Takes a Village” pre-accelerator, and as one of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce’s #ChooseATL Influencers for 2019. She is also a graduate of the City of Atlanta’s Women’s Entrepreneurship Initiative (WEI ‘18), and LaunchPad2x.",
